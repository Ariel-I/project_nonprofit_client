# Project Nonprofit 

Welcome to Project Nonprofit frontend! This is an application that stores information about some of the worlds largest nonprofit organizations, who they are, and what they do.

Project Nonprofits frontend utilizes React and Redux while handeling the backend with a Rails API. This is one of two repositories that will need to be run in conjunction. The backend repository can be found here: 
https://github.com/Ariel-I/Project_Nonprofit_API

## Installation

Begin by setting up the Rails backend first then run the following commands to set up the fontend;

```
$npm install 
```
```
$npm start 
```

Once the npm server is running as well as the rails server the application will render as a localhost.
